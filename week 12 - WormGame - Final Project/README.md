This is the final Project of the MOOC:

Its the clasic Worm Game, move it with the Arrow Keys and dont hit yourself or the walls,
the worm grow when it catch an apple and get faster.

If you want you can change the size of the board in the the main class changing the parameters in
the creation of the WormGame (... new WormGame(width, heigth)). Also you can change the size of the
worm or the apple when creating the interface (... new UserInterface(game, piecesLength)).

As the programing part, the worm is an array of "Pieces", and when it moves, it deletes the oldest one
and create a new one in the new coordinate, except when you catch an apple (then the next time it moves
doesnt remove his tail).

Hope you enjoy it and if you are looking to learn OOP with Java this MOOC is the best option.
